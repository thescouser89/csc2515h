function yhat = nb_decision(X,p_y,p_x_given_y)
  % Computes a vector of binary predictions, where each entry 
  % corresponds to the predicted label for it's associated row in X.
  % Given:
  %   X   		   - a num_cases by num_dims array of binary inputs.
  %   p_y  	 	   - an array with two elements corresponding to the prior class
  %			        probabilities.
  %   p_x_given_y - A 2 by num_dims matrix corresponding to the naive Bayes
  %                 probabilities for each attribute.
    
  % Returns:
  % A vector of class predictions for each example in X.
